OVERVIEW:
There are two (2) applications that together will control a RPI via
messages received from MQTT Mosquitto.

The two applications are: mqttDirector, and mqttController.

mqttDirector sends requests to mqttController.  mqttcontroller then
performs the requested action.

The requests for action are transported from the mqttDirector to the
mqttController via an MQTT Moquitto broker, running on the node Hottub.

mqttDirector is an application that runs on the node Hottub.  It utilizes
the MQTT Mosquitto Server (or Broker - an older terminology), which has
to be installed on Hottub and run as a service.  Please refer to MQTT
Mosquitto for more information as to installing and setting up the
MQTT Mosquitto server.

mqttDirector is a terminal-based assplication, and has a simple text-based 
menu enterface.

Running mqttDirector will present a menu of choices.  E.g., 'echo', when 
entered as the menu command, will cause all RPIs that are listening to the
mqttDirector, to reply with their nodename.

The MQTT Topics utilized are:

    CONTROLLER/ACTION
        Commands sent from mqttDirector are sent with Topic CONTROLLER/ACTION

    CONTROLLER/RESPONSE
        Responses from mqttController are sent with Topic CONTROLLER/RESPONSE

    CONTROLLER/#
        Enables you to monitor both 'channels'.

The utility mqttMonitorRPIChannels allows the monitoring of both channels, 
CONTROLLER/ACTION and CONTROLLER/RESPONSE.  It can be redirected to a
file when starting it.


SETUP:
In order to run the python application mqttDirector, several things must
be set up first; it is also dependent on the application mqttController
to run the commands on a RPI via MQTT Mosquitto.

Please perform the following commands, in order, on the RPI that will be 
utilized for mqttController.

1.  Install paho-mqtt.
    This provides python the ability to communicate via MQTT.
    Reference: https://pypi.org/project/paho-mqtt
    
    command: sudo install paho-mqtt

2.  mqttDirector.py provides commands to shutdown or reboot the RPI.
    These commands require root privilidges, making use of the 'sudo' command
    'sudo' requires authentication, in the form of a login password.  This
    is not convenient while running the application.  Therefore, the following
    changes will need to be made to the file: /etc/sudoers.d/010_pi-nopasswd

    2.1.1 Change to /ect/subdoers.d
        cd /etc/subdoers.d

    2.1.2 Make a copy of suduoers.d/010_pi-nonpasswd.  It is protected, so use 'sudo'
        sudo cp 010_pi-nopasswd 010_pi-nopasswd.original

    2.1.3 Now edit the 010_pi-nopasswd file
        Edit 010_pi-nopasswd, and add the following two entries

        pi RPI-Dev =NOPASSWD: /bin/systemctl poweroff,/bin/systemctl halt,/bin/systemctl reboot
        pi RPI-Dev =NOPASSWD: /sbin/reboot

        Save your work.

    2.2.    You may have to logout then login for it to work.  Or, if that doesn't work, 
            you may have to reboot.  You can test via 'sudo reboot', providing you haven't 
            already performed a sudo and authenticated while in this session.

3.  Assuming you have made changes outlined in section 2 above, and have tested it and it
    works properly, you can move on to the next step.

4.  Hottub is the main system for development, but the mqttDirector will be running on a
    RPI.  Therefore, it is best to mount the development Hottub into a directory located
    on the RPI.

    So, we are going to use ssfs to mount the Hottub's directory to the RPI's /media subdirectory.

    4.1  As pi, perform the following:

        4.1.1 cd to the RPI directory /media
            cd /media

        4.1.2 create the directory Hottub.  This is where the Hottub code will mount.  
            sudo mkdir Hottub

        4.1.3 Directory Hottub is probably owned by root, so you'll need to change it, but
            First, verify that it is owned by root by doing a 'ls -al' 

                ls -al /media

            If it is owned by 'root root', then you'll want to change it to pi pi by issuing:
            
                sudo chown pi:pi Hottub

            Now ensure it is correct by doing ls -al /media and observing the ownserhip of pi pi

                ls -al /media 
            

        4.1.4 Now we are going to create a flag-file to show wherether Hottub's directory
            has been mounted or not. Well do this by issueing the 'touch' command
            for a file named 'NOT_MOUNTED'.  If in the future you do a ls -al /media/Hottub
            and you see the file 'NOT_MOUNTED', then you know your Hottub file system has
            not been mounted, and you'll need to do the 'sshfs' command (down below).

                First, cd to the Hottub directory you just created:

                    cd /media/Hottub

                Now, using 'touch' create the file NOT_MOUNTED

                    touch NOT_MOUNTED

            Now, make sure you've created this file by doing ls -al

                    ls -al

            You should see the file NOT_MOUNTED in /media/Hottub.

        4.1.5  The directory on Hottub that contains the file mqttDirector, is located at
            /home/superben/MySoftwareProjects/mqttDirector/.  So we are going to mount this 
            directory at the mount point you just created: /media/Hottub

                sshfs -o nonempty superben@hottub.local:./MySoftwareProjects/mqttDirector   /media/Hottub

            Note: if your system complains that it does not have the command 'ssfs', then issue
            the following command:

                sudo install sshfs

        4.1.6 Confirm that you have mounted the directory properly by performing 'ls -al'

                ls -al /media/Hottub
            
            You should see many files, not the single file NOT_MOUNTED.

        4.1.7 Ensure you have a ~/bin directory, and also that your $PATH contains an entry
            to include this directory for command searches.  If you do not have a ~/bin directory,
            then make one:
                
                mkdir ~/bin

            Now cd to the bin directory

                cd ~/bin

        4.1.8 We will put the command mqttDirector into bin, but it will really be a link to the mqttDirector
            located on Hottub, which we will get to by linking to the /media/Hottub filesystem.

            First, create the link:
    
                ln -s mqttDirectory /media/Hottub

            Now confirm the link:

                ls -al mqttDirectory

           It should show that this is a link, by displaying '->' as part of the name.

5.  Your system should already have python3 installed. Let's check; Ctrl-Z will exit it.

        python3

    You should see some lines of text, with the last line showing ">>>".  If you see this, then
    you should be good.  The version that I'm showing right now, and that the application was 
    developed and tested on, is Python 3.5.3 (this should be the first line of the output from
    your 'python3' command.  If you don't see this, or if you get an error trying to invoke 'python3',
    then you will need to install python3.  Please perform a google search of Raspberry Pi python3' and 
    follow installation instructions.

6.  Your system should now be properly set up to run mqttDirector.

    Issue the following command:

    python3 -O mqttDirector.py   (Note: this option -O surpresses debug output.  For the first run, I would suggest -O)

    or

    python3 mqttDirector.py      (Note: the lack of the -O option means debug info will be displayed.)

7.  If you have sucessfully completed the application installation, you should see the file ~/bin/mqttActions.txt, 
    which is the log file for the application.  You can create a new log file, while retaining up to 5 total
    files.  To do this, on Hottub, from the application 'mqttDirector', select the 'newLog' command.
